# ME6900_Rockets
Repo for ME6900 class; Team: Jack Kirschler &amp; Tony Tonkovich (Area = 0.5 m^2)

HW #1 - Completed Individually

HW #2 - Completed Individually

HW #3 - Completed as Team using separate MATLAB scripts

Project 1 - 
- [x] Part 1. Develop a rocket design using OpenRocket or similar to meet requirements and document results
- [ ] Part 2. Develop Simulink dynamics model of a rocket meeting requirements
    - [x] 1. Use the frontal area from the last assignment.
    - [x] 2. Model motor as square wave output (based on standard size).
    - [ ] 3. Import drag coefficient data from RockSim/OpenRocket drag coefficient.
    - [ ] 4. Combine drag force and motor force and feed into 3 DoF equations of motion block.
       - [x] 4a. The use of your atmosphere model is required here
    - [x] 5. Specify mass and gravity force into 3DoF block. Optional to lose mass during flight.
    - [x] 6. Feedback the body velocity to be used for the aerodynamic calculations.
    - [ ] 7. Define a stop condition at apogee (maximum height reached).
    - [ ] 8. Add scopes to all major areas: Total drag force, motor force, combined forces, body velocity, dynamic pressure, altitude and position (Z & X), body accelerations, and any other significate data that shows details about flight or the model.
    - [ ] 9. Simulate and tweak motor parameters to meet requirements.
    - [ ] 10. Plot and report data using professional graphs/figures (export to matlab workspace).
- [ ] Part 3. Presentation: 5 slides max detailing your model, how it works, and results
